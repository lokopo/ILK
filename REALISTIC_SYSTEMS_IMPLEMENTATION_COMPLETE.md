- **Repair System**: Use spare parts to fix damaged components

### **2. ⛽ Realistic Fuel System**
- **Fuel Consumption**: Based on distance traveled, ship mass, and engine efficiency
- **Fuel Efficiency**: Affected by engine and fuel tank condition
- **Fuel Stations**: 70% of planets have fuel stations with varying prices
- **Emergency Situations**: Ship stops moving when fuel runs out
- **Refueling**: Press 'F' near planets to refuel (costs credits)

### **3. 👥 Enhanced Crew Specialization**
- **Multiple Skills**: Engineering, Piloting, Combat, Medical, Science, Leadership
- **Specialization Bonuses**: Crew members excel in their chosen field
- **Experience System**: Crew gains experience and improves skills over time
- **Fatigue & Health**: Crew performance affected by fatigue and health status
- **Realistic Wages**: Based on skill levels and experience

### **4. 🏭 Enhanced Manufacturing System**
- **Complex Recipes**: Multi-step manufacturing requiring specific inputs
- **Manufacturing Chains**: Basic Components → Advanced Components → Weapons/Medicine
- **Skill Dependencies**: Different recipes require different crew specializations
- **Processing Time**: Manufacturing takes real time to complete
- **Planet Specialization**: Different planet types focus on different manufacturing

### **5. 🔗 Interconnected Dependencies**

#### **Fuel Dependencies:**
- Ship movement requires fuel
- Fuel consumption increases with cargo load and damaged engines
- Planets with fuel stations become strategically important
- Emergency situations when fuel runs low

#### **Component Dependencies:**
- Engine damage reduces speed and increases fuel consumption
- Cargo bay damage reduces carrying capacity
- Shield damage makes ship vulnerable to pirate attacks
- Life support damage affects crew health over time

#### **Manufacturing Dependencies:**
- Advanced Components require Basic Components + Technology + Minerals
- Weapons require Advanced Components + Technology + Minerals
- Medicine requires Spices + Technology + Basic Components
- Creates supply chains where planets depend on each other

#### **Crew Dependencies:**
- Engineering crew needed for repairs and manufacturing
- Pilot crew improves fuel efficiency and gains experience
- Medical crew maintains crew health
- Skilled crew required for advanced manufacturing

## 🔗 **Interconnected Dependencies Created**

### **Fuel → Movement → Economy:**
- Need fuel to travel → Must visit fuel stations → Creates trade routes
- Fuel costs money → Need profitable cargo runs → Economic planning required

### **Components → Performance → Strategy:**
- Damaged engines → Slower travel + more fuel consumption → Route planning
- Damaged cargo bay → Less carrying capacity → Fewer profitable runs

### **Manufacturing → Transport → Specialization:**
- Basic Components needed for Advanced Components → Transport dependency
- Planets specialize in different manufacturing → Trade network formation

### **Crew → Ship Performance → Economic Success:**
- Skilled crew → Better ship efficiency → Lower operating costs
- Experienced pilots → Better fuel efficiency → More profitable routes
