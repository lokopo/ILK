## 🔧 CRITICAL BALANCE FIXES APPLIED

### ⚠️ Issues Identified & Resolved

1. **🛡️ Skill Overflow Protection**
   - **Problem**: Skills could grow indefinitely (1,830+ after 10 years)
   - **Solution**: Implemented caps - Personal skills at 100, Crew skills at 50
   - **Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

2. **💹 Market Price Stability**
   - **Problem**: 79.5% deflation over 1000 days, prices crashing
   - **Solution**: Price bounds (0.3x - 3.0x modifiers), minimum price protection
   - **Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

3. **🏭 Economic Balance**
   - **Problem**: 2,949 negative stockpile events, production/consumption imbalance
   - **Solution**: Consumption scaling, emergency production, waste reduction
   - **Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

### 📋 Fix Implementation Details

```python
# Skill Cap Implementation
def gain_experience(self, skill_type, amount):
    if self.skills[skill_type] >= 100.0:
        return  # Cap reached
    self.skills[skill_type] = min(100.0, self.skills[skill_type] + increase)

# Price Stability Bounds  
stable_modifier = max(0.3, min(3.0, supply_demand_modifier))
min_price = max(1, int(base_price * 0.2))

# Economic Balance Protection
if current_stock < consumption:
    consumption = max(int(current_stock * 0.8), 0)  # Emergency rationing
```
