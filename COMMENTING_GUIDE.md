```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
ILK SPACE GAME - MAIN GAME ENGINE
================================

This is the primary game engine file for the ILK Space Game, a comprehensive
3D space exploration and trading game inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates! but
set in a futuristic space environment.

The game features:
- 6DOF space flight with realistic physics
- Planetary landing and surface exploration
- Complex economic trading system with 8 commodity types
- 6 major factions with political relationships
- 10 different ship classes with unique capabilities
- Crew management with 6 personal skills
- Tactical combat with boarding and capture mechanics
- Dynamic mission generation and contract system
- Transport network with multiple ship types
- Manufacturing and upgrade systems
- Real-time progression with day/night cycles

```

### **2. Section Headers with Visual Separators**
```python
# =============================================================================
# STANDARD LIBRARY IMPORTS
# =============================================================================
import os          # Operating system interface for file operations and environment variables
import sys         # System-specific parameters and functions for Python runtime
import logging     # Logging facility for debugging and error tracking
import traceback   # Print or retrieve a stack traceback for error handling
```

### **3. Comprehensive Variable Documentation**
```python
# =============================================================================
# ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION AND LOGGING SETUP
# =============================================================================

# Check if verbose logging is enabled via environment variable
# This allows for detailed debugging output when needed
verbose = os.environ.get('GAME_VERBOSE', '0') == '1'

# Configure the logging system with appropriate level and format
# DEBUG level shows all messages, INFO level shows important messages only
# Log format includes timestamp, log level, and message content
# Output goes to both console (stdout) and log file for persistent debugging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG if verbose else logging.INFO,  # Use DEBUG if verbose, otherwise INFO
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',  # Timestamp - Level - Message format
    handlers=[
        logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout),           # Console output handler
        logging.FileHandler('space_game.log', mode='w')  # File output handler (overwrites each run)
    ]
)
```

### **4. Comprehensive Function Documentation**
```python
def load_texture(path):
    """
    Mock texture loading function for headless mode.
    
    This function provides the same interface as the real texture loading
    function but returns a mock texture identifier instead of actually
    loading graphics files. This allows the game logic to run normally
    in headless mode without requiring graphics capabilities.
    
    Args:
        path (str): Path to the texture file (e.g., "assets/textures/skybox.png")
        
    Returns:
        str: Mock texture identifier in format "texture_<path>"
        
    Example:
        >>> load_texture("assets/textures/skybox.png")
        'texture_assets/textures/skybox.png'
    """
    return f"texture_{path}"
```

### **5. Comprehensive Class Documentation**
```python
class FirstPersonController:
    """
    Mock First Person Controller for headless mode.
    
    This class provides the same interface as the real FirstPersonController
    but without actual movement, physics, or input processing. It's used
    for headless mode where the player character needs to exist but doesn't
    need to actually move or respond to input.
    
    The controller manages:
    - Player position and orientation in 3D space
    - Movement parameters (speed, jump height, etc.)
    - Physics state (grounded, velocity, gravity)
    - Input sensitivity and camera settings
    - Entity relationships and UI elements
    
    Attributes:
        position (Vec3): Current position in 3D space (x, y, z coordinates)
        rotation (Vec3): Current rotation (pitch, yaw, roll in degrees)
        enabled (bool): Whether the controller is active and responding to input
        speed (float): Movement speed multiplier (affects all movement)
        jump_height (float): Maximum height of jumps in world units
        jump_up_time (float): Time in seconds to reach maximum jump height
        fall_after (float): Time in seconds before gravity affects jump
        mouse_sensitivity (Vec3): Mouse sensitivity for look controls (x, y, z)
        grounded (bool): Whether the character is currently on the ground
        y (float): Y-axis position (height above ground level)
        gravity (float): Gravity strength multiplier (1.0 = normal gravity)
        velocity (Vec3): Current movement velocity vector (x, y, z)
        on_ground (bool): Whether the character is touching the ground
        air_time (float): Time spent in the air (used for jump mechanics)
        traverse_target (Entity): Target entity for movement traversal
        model (Entity): Character model entity for visual representation
        parent (Entity): Parent entity in the scene hierarchy
        third_person (bool): Whether in third-person view mode
        axis_indicator (Entity): Visual indicator for movement axes
    """
```

### **6. Comprehensive Method Documentation**
```python
def handle_text_command(self, command):
    """
    Handle text-mode commands.
    
    This method processes all user commands in text mode, routing them
    to the appropriate game systems. It provides a command-line interface
    for all major game features including navigation, trading, combat,
    and system management.
    
    The command processor supports:
    - Game control (quit, help, save)
    - Navigation (status, planets, fly, land, takeoff)
    - Economy (trade, wallet)
    - Fleet management (fleet, character)
    - Exploration (scan)
    - System utilities (contracts, test)
    
    Args:
        command (str): The user's command (already converted to lowercase
                      and stripped of whitespace)
                      
    Example:
        >>> handle_text_command("fly earth")
        # Processes fly command to travel to Earth planet
        
        >>> handle_text_command("trade")
        # Opens trading interface for buying/selling goods
        
        >>> handle_text_command("unknown")
        # Displays error message about unknown command
    """
```

### **7. Logic Block Documentation**
```python
# =============================================================================
# GAME CONTROL COMMANDS
# =============================================================================
if command == "quit" or command == "exit":
    # Exit the game gracefully by setting the main loop flag to False
    # This allows the game to clean up resources and save state before exiting
    self.running = False
    
elif command == "help":
    # Display comprehensive help information showing all available commands
    # Organized by category (navigation, economy, fleet, etc.) for easy reference
    self.show_text_help()

# =============================================================================
# NAVIGATION AND EXPLORATION COMMANDS
# =============================================================================
elif command == "status":
    # Show current player status including position, fuel, credits, and location
    # This provides a quick overview of the player's current state
    self.show_text_status()
    
elif command == "planets":
    # List all available planets with their distances, types, and characteristics
    # Helps the player plan their next destination
    self.show_text_planets()
    
elif command.startswith("fly "):
    # Fly to a specific planet (requires planet name as parameter)
    # Extracts the planet name from the command and initiates travel
    # Travel consumes fuel based on distance and ship efficiency
    planet_name = command[4:].strip()  # Extract planet name from "fly <planet>"
    self.text_fly_to_planet(planet_name)
```

### **8. Error Handling Documentation**
```python
try:
    # Get user input with a command prompt
    user_input = input("\nSpaceGame> ")
    
    # Handle empty or None input gracefully
    if user_input is None:
        continue
    
    # Process the command by converting to lowercase and removing whitespace
    command = user_input.strip().lower()
    
    # Handle the command through the command processor
    self.handle_text_command(command)
    
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    # Handle Ctrl+C gracefully with a friendly message
    # This allows users to exit the game cleanly without error messages
    print("\nüõë Game interrupted by user")
    break
    
except EOFError:
    # Handle end-of-file (Ctrl+D) gracefully
    # This occurs when the input stream is closed, common in automated testing
    print("\nüëã Goodbye!")
    break
    
except Exception as e:
    # Handle any other unexpected errors with error reporting
    # This catches programming errors and provides debugging information
    print(f"‚ùå Error: {e}")
```

---

## üîß **COMMENTING BEST PRACTICES**

### **1. Explain the "Why" Not Just the "What"**
```python
# GOOD: Explains why this approach was chosen
self.text_fuel = 100.0  # Starting fuel level - high enough for initial exploration
                        # but low enough to encourage fuel management strategy

# BAD: Just states what the code does
self.text_fuel = 100.0  # Set fuel to 100
```

### **2. Provide Context for Complex Logic**
```python
# GOOD: Explains the business logic
if fuel_cost > self.text_fuel:
    print(f"‚ùå Not enough fuel! Need {fuel_cost:.1f}, have {self.text_fuel:.1f}")
    return
# This prevents players from traveling without sufficient fuel, encouraging
# strategic fuel management and trading decisions

# BAD: No context
if fuel_cost > self.text_fuel:
    print("Not enough fuel")
    return
```

### **3. Document Edge Cases and Assumptions**
```python
# GOOD: Documents assumptions and edge cases
planet_name = command[4:].strip()  # Extract planet name from "fly <planet>"
                                   # Assumes command format is "fly " followed by planet name
                                   # Handles extra whitespace with strip()

# BAD: No explanation of assumptions
planet_name = command[4:].strip()
```

### **4. Use Consistent Formatting**
```python
# GOOD: Consistent comment formatting
self.position = Vec3(0, 0, 0)      # Current position (x, y, z)
self.rotation = Vec3(0, 0, 0)      # Current rotation (pitch, yaw, roll)
self.enabled = True                 # Whether the controller is active
self.speed = 5                      # Base movement speed multiplier

# BAD: Inconsistent formatting
self.position = Vec3(0, 0, 0)  # position
self.rotation = Vec3(0, 0, 0)  # rotation
self.enabled = True  # enabled
self.speed = 5  # speed
```
