# Pirate Transport System - Test Scenarios & Implementation

## 🏴‍☠️ **Pirate System Overview**

The pirate transport system extends the realistic transport mechanics with **intelligent pirate operations** that create genuine threats to the economy. Pirates are no longer random encounters - they're **strategic actors** with their own supply chains, intelligence networks, and economic motivations.

---

## 🧪 **Test Scenario 1: Intelligent Pirate Raid**

### **Setup:**
1. Agricultural Planet A produces food → sends to Mining Planet B
2. Pirate Base C observes cargo ship patterns and builds intelligence cache
3. Pirate Base C runs low on food supplies

### **Expected Behavior:**
```
📨 Message ship: Agricultural Planet A → Mining Planet B (GOODS_REQUEST)
🚛 Cargo ship launched: Agricultural Planet A → Mining Planet B
   Cargo: 150 food
   Value: 1500 credits

🕵️ Pirate Base C received intelligence: {'food': 150} worth 1500

🏴‍☠️ Pirate raider launched from Pirate Base C
   Target: {'food': 150} worth 1500 credits

🏴‍☠️ PIRATE ATTACK!
Raider attacking cargo ship: 150 food

💀 Pirate raid successful! Stolen: 150 food
   Value: 1500 credits

📉 Mining Planet B supply disruption: -150 food
🏴‍☠️ Raider returned to Pirate Base C
   Delivered stolen goods: 150 food
```

### **Real Consequences:**
- Mining Planet B doesn't receive expected food delivery
- Prices on Mining Planet B increase due to actual shortage
- Pirate Base C's food stockpiles increase
- Other pirate bases receive intelligence about this profitable route

## 🧪 **Test Scenario 2: Contraband Smuggling Network**

### **Setup:**
1. Pirate Base A accumulates stolen goods from successful raids
2. Pirate Base B needs weapons for upcoming raids
3. Underground trade network facilitates contraband exchange

### **Expected Behavior:**
```
📦 Pirate Base A received stolen goods: {'weapons': 50, 'technology': 20}

🚭 Smuggler launched: Pirate Base A → Pirate Base B
   Contraband: 25 STOLEN_GOODS

🚔 Law enforcement scanning smuggler ship!
🤐 Smuggler evaded detection

🚭 Contraband delivered to Pirate Base B

💰 Fence payment: Pirate Base B → Pirate Base A (1875 credits)
💳 Fence payment delivered: 1875 credits
```

### **Real Consequences:**
- Pirate bases trade stolen goods like any other commodity
- Risk of law enforcement interception adds tension
- Black market payments flow through fence networks
- Creates underground economy separate from legal trade

---

## 🧪 **Test Scenario 3: Intelligence Sharing Network**

### **Setup:**
1. Multiple pirate bases exist in the same sector
2. One base gathers intelligence about valuable cargo route
3. Information gets shared across pirate network

### **Expected Behavior:**
```
🕵️ Pirate Base Alpha received intelligence: {'luxury_goods': 100} worth 7500

📨 Message ship launched: Pirate Base Alpha → Pirate Base Beta (RAID_INTELLIGENCE)
📬 Message delivered to Pirate Base Beta: RAID_INTELLIGENCE

🕵️ Pirate Base Beta received intelligence: {'luxury_goods': 100} worth 7500

🏴‍☠️ Pirate raider launched from Pirate Base Beta
   Target: {'luxury_goods': 100} worth 7500 credits
```

### **Real Consequences:**
- Pirates coordinate attacks on profitable routes
- Intelligence spreads through pirate networks
- Multiple pirate bases may target the same cargo ships
- Creates persistent threat to high-value trade routes

---

## 🧪 **Test Scenario 4: Supply Chain Warfare**

### **Setup:**
1. Player identifies critical supply route: Tech Planet → Military Planet
2. Player allies with pirates to disrupt enemy faction supply lines
3. Coordinated attacks create economic warfare

### **Expected Behavior:**
```
🚛 Cargo ship launched: Tech Planet → Military Planet
   Cargo: 200 weapons, 50 technology
   Value: 14500 credits

🏴‍☠️ PIRATE ATTACK!
💀 Pirate raid successful! Stolen: 200 weapons, 50 technology

📉 Military Planet supply disruption: -200 weapons, -50 technology
📉 Military Planet weapon shortage critical!

📨 Message ship: Military Planet → Tech Planet (URGENT_REQUEST)
   Commodity: weapons, Urgency: CRITICAL, Price: 120 per unit
```

### **Real Consequences:**
- Military planet suffers actual weapon shortages
- Prices increase dramatically due to real scarcity
- Urgent procurement messages sent at premium prices
- Faction military strength actually weakened by supply disruption

---

## 🧪 **Test Scenario 5: Player Intervention**

### **Setup:**
1. Player observes pirate raider hunting cargo ships
2. Player can choose to: defend cargo, attack pirates, or stay neutral
3. Player actions affect real economic outcomes

### **Expected Behavior:**
```
🚢 CARGO SHIP ENCOUNTER!
Ship from Agricultural Planet to Mining Planet
Cargo: 150 food
Value: 1500 credits

🏴‍☠️ PIRATE ATTACK!
[Player intervenes and destroys pirate raider]

✅ Cargo delivered to Mining Planet: 150 food
💳 Payment delivered to Agricultural Planet: 1500 credits

[Faction reputation changes]
+15 Reputation with Mining Planet faction
+10 Reputation with Merchant Guild
-20 Reputation with Outer Rim Pirates
```

### **Real Consequences:**
- Player actions directly affect supply chain success/failure
- Protecting cargo maintains economic stability
- Attacking cargo disrupts real trade
- Reputation changes based on actual economic impact

---

## 🧪 **Test Scenario 6: Pirate Base Economics**

### **Setup:**
1. Pirate base consumes food, fuel, weapons, medicine
2. Stockpiles run low, triggering procurement needs
3. Pirates must raid or trade to maintain operations

### **Expected Behavior:**
```
⚠️ Pirate Base Skull Island running low on food (5 days remaining)
⚠️ Pirate Base Skull Island running low on medicine (3 days remaining)

🏴‍☠️ Pirate raider launched from Skull Island
   [Hunting for food and medicine cargo]

💀 Pirate raid successful! Stolen: 100 food, 30 medicine
📦 Skull Island received stolen goods: {'food': 100, 'medicine': 30}

[Base stockpiles replenished, raids can continue]
```

### **Real Consequences:**
- Pirates have genuine economic motivations for raiding
- Successful raids sustain pirate operations
- Failed raids weaken pirate bases
- Creates realistic boom/bust cycles for pirate activity

---

## 🎯 **Performance Metrics**

### **Expected Activity Levels:**
- **Active Raiders**: 2-5 per pirate base
- **Smuggler Runs**: 1-3 active contraband deliveries
- **Intelligence Messages**: 1-2 per hour between pirate bases
- **Successful Raids**: 30-50% success rate against cargo ships
- **Law Enforcement Interdiction**: 10-20% of smuggling attempts

### **Economic Impact:**
- **Supply Chain Disruption**: 5-15% of cargo shipments lost to piracy
- **Price Volatility**: 20-50% price increases in raid-affected sectors
- **Black Market Value**: Contraband worth 150-300% of legal equivalents
- **Pirate Revenue**: 2000-8000 credits per successful raid

## 🔧 **Integration Instructions**

### **Step 1: Add Pirate System Code**
```python
# After adding TRANSPORT_SYSTEM_PATCH.py to space_game.py
# Add PIRATE_TRANSPORT_SYSTEM.py code
```

### **Step 2: Create Pirate Bases**
```python
# Convert some planets to pirate bases
for planet in planets:
    if "pirate" in planet.name.lower() or planet.faction == "outer_rim_pirates":
        planet.economy = PirateBaseEconomy(planet.name)
        planet.economy.planet_object = planet
```

### **Step 3: Update Main Loop**
```python
def update():
    # ... existing code ...
    transport_system.update()
    pirate_transport_system.update()  # Add this line
```

### **Step 4: Add UI Statistics**
```python
# In SpaceController class
pirate_stats = pirate_transport_system.get_pirate_statistics()
self.pirate_text.text = f"Pirates: {pirate_stats['total_pirate_ships']} " \
                       f"(R:{pirate_stats['active_raiders']} " \
                       f"S:{pirate_stats['active_smugglers']})"
```
