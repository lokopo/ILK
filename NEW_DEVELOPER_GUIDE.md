## üõ†Ô∏è **COMMON DEVELOPMENT TASKS (10 Minutes)**

### **Task 1: Adding a New Ship Class**

#### **What You Need to Know:**
- Ships are defined in the `ShipClass` enum (around line 510)
- Ship stats are in the `ShipStats` class (around line 523)
- Each ship has: health, speed, cargo, combat power, etc.

#### **Step-by-Step:**
1. Find the `ShipClass` enum (search for "class ShipClass")
2. Add your new ship type: `YOUR_SHIP = "Your Ship"`
3. Find the `SHIP_STATS` dictionary (around line 550)
4. Add stats for your ship: `ShipClass.YOUR_SHIP: ShipStats(...)`

#### **Example:**
```python
# In ShipClass enum
EXPLORER = "Explorer"

# In SHIP_STATS dictionary
ShipClass.EXPLORER: ShipStats(300, 20, 150, 90, 0.7, 200, 30, 500, 3, 350000),
```

### **Task 2: Adding a New Commodity**

#### **What You Need to Know:**
- Commodities are defined in the `Commodity` class (around line 815)
- Each commodity has: name, base price, type
- Commodities affect trading and economy

#### **Step-by-Step:**
1. Find where commodities are created (search for "Commodity(")
2. Add your new commodity following the same pattern
3. Make sure to add it to the commodity list

#### **Example:**
```python
# Add to commodity list
"Plasma": Commodity("Plasma", 120.0, CommodityType.TECHNOLOGY),
```

### **Task 3: Changing Game Balance**

#### **What You Need to Know:**
- Most game values are defined as constants
- Look for numbers that seem like game parameters
- Test your changes by running the game

#### **Common Balance Changes:**
- **Starting money**: Search for "credits" and "1000"
- **Ship prices**: Search for ship costs in `SHIP_STATS`
- **Trading prices**: Search for "base_price" in commodities
- **Movement speed**: Search for "speed" in ship stats

## üêõ **DEBUGGING GUIDE (5 Minutes)**

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **"The game won't start"**
1. Check Python version: `python --version` (needs 3.7+)
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Check for error messages in the console
4. Try running: `python run_me.py --verbose`

#### **"I can't find what I'm looking for"**
1. Use the search function (Ctrl+F)
2. Check the `NAVIGATION_GUIDE.md` file
3. Look at the `CLASS_FUNCTION_INDEX.md` file
4. Search for keywords related to what you want to change

#### **"My changes aren't working"**
1. Make sure you saved the file
2. Restart the game completely
3. Check for syntax errors (Python will show them)
4. Look at the console for error messages

#### **"I don't understand this code"**
1. Read the comments - they explain everything
2. Look at similar code for examples
3. Check the `COMMENTING_GUIDE.md` file
4. Ask questions in the project documentation

### **Debugging Tools**

#### **Console Output**
- The game prints helpful messages to the console
- Look for error messages and warnings

#### **Log Files**
- Check `space_game.log` for detailed error information
- Logs show what the game is doing and where errors occur

#### **Testing Mode**
- Run `python run_me.py --test` to run automated tests
