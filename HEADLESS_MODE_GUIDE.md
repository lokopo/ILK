# ILK Space Game - Headless Mode Guide

## Overview

The ILK Space Game now supports true headless mode operation, allowing you to run the game without graphics for testing, simulation, and server deployment scenarios.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run in headless mode (interactive)
python run_me.py --headless

# Run stability tests
python run_me.py --headless --test

# Run with verbose logging
python run_me.py --headless --verbose

# Force GUI mode even in headless environment
python run_me.py --force-gui
```

### Direct Headless Script Usage

```bash
# Interactive mode
python space_game_headless.py

# Run stability tests
python space_game_headless.py test

# Run economic simulation (30 days)
python space_game_headless.py sim

# Run economic simulation (custom days)
python space_game_headless.py sim 60
```

## Command Line Options

### run_me.py Options

```
--headless         Run in headless mode (no graphics)
--test             Run stability tests instead of the game
--verbose, -v      Enable verbose logging
--force-gui        Force GUI mode even in headless environment
--diagnostics      Run system diagnostics before launching
```

### Interactive Commands (Headless Mode)

```
help               Show available commands
test               Run comprehensive stability tests
sim [days]         Run economic simulation (default 30 days)
status             Show current system status
quit / exit        Exit the program
```

## System Requirements

### Headless Mode
- Python 3.7+
- numpy (for mathematical calculations)
- No graphics libraries required

### GUI Mode
- All headless requirements plus:
- ursina engine
- pygame
- OpenGL support
- Desktop environment

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Graphics not available" 
**Solution:** Use headless mode:
```bash
python run_me.py --headless
```

### Issue: "Headless components failed to load"
**Solution:** Check dependencies:
```bash
python run_me.py --diagnostics
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: Game crashes during headless tests
**Solution:** Enable verbose logging for detailed diagnostics:
```bash
python run_me.py --headless --test --verbose
```

### Issue: Economic simulation shows instability
**Expected:** This indicates potential balance issues in the game economy that need attention.

## Use Cases

### 🖥️ Server Deployment
Run the game on headless servers for:
- Continuous integration testing
- Automated balance validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Economic model validation

### 🧪 Development Testing
Use for:
- Feature stability verification
- Regression testing
- Performance profiling
- Economic balance analysis

### 🔬 Research & Analysis
Perfect for:
- Economic model research
- Game balance analysis
- Long-term simulation studies
- Algorithm validation

## Log Files

The system creates detailed log files:

- `game_launch.log` - Launcher diagnostics
- `space_game_headless.log` - Headless mode operation
- `space_game.log` - GUI mode operation

## Examples

### Running a 100-day Economic Simulation

```bash
python run_me.py --headless
> sim 100
```

### Automated Testing in CI/CD

```bash
# In your CI script
python run_me.py --headless --test --verbose
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ Game stability tests passed"
else
    echo "❌ Game stability tests failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Docker Container Usage

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "run_me.py", "--headless", "--test"]
```

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Launcher (`run_me.py`)**: Environment detection and script coordination
- **Headless Runner (`space_game_headless.py`)**: Dedicated headless functionality
- **Mock Framework (`headless_game_test.py`)**: Graphics-free game simulation
- **Main Game (`space_game.py`)**: Full game with conditional headless support

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when graphics unavailable
- Comprehensive logging at multiple levels
- Signal handling for clean shutdown
- Exception tracking with stack traces

## Contributing

When adding new features:

1. **Add headless tests** for any new game mechanics
2. **Update mock components** if new graphics elements are used  
3. **Test both modes** (GUI and headless) before submitting
4. **Update documentation** for any new command-line options

## Performance Notes

- Headless mode typically runs 10-50x faster than GUI mode
- Memory usage is reduced by ~70% without graphics
- CPU usage focuses on game logic rather than rendering
- Suitable for long-running simulations and batch testing
